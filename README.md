# CatchTheHash
CatchTheHash is a game that I have developed using Python in order to improve my coding skills and also have a bit of fun on the way.

# How to play?
When you run the progrm, use the up and down arrow keys to change the mode and press the enter key to select one. Then use the same keys to select one of the three characters. If you feel the need to go back, use backspace key. Press enter to select the character and the game begins. Use the WASD keys to move your character and press q if you wish to quit.

# What's the objective?
When the game begins, depending on the chosen difficulty, you will have a certain no. of steps that you can take (moves that you can make) and you must catch the hash before you run out. You also need to be careful not to run into yourself or you'll eat your own tail and lose a life point. Remember, you only have three lives.
# Thank you!
Thank you for playing my silly game and have a great day.
